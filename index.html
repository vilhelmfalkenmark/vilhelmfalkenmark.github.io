                    <h2 id="lifeStory">My name is Vilhelm Falkenmark and I am currently 28 years old</h2>

                    <p>I was born In Stockholm, Sweden on the 22nd of june 1986 as the second-eldest sibling among four.

                        <br><br> When I was a kid I was obsessed with Lego, Turtles and Batman. When I turned 10 I discovered Kiss (the band) and my life changed forever to come.
                        I started playing guitar when I was 13 and it has been my main hobby since then. During my youth I spent my free-time playing in various bands and music projects.
                        <br><br>
                        After I finished high-school I went to Australia for 6 months with one of my best friends to "discover myself" and "find out what I really want to do with my life". I did
                        not really achieve that. Instead I applied for an education in Business and Economics. I moved to Uppsala when I turned 20 and studied there for 4 years and 6 months abroad in Maastricht, The Netherlands.
                        I took my Degree of Masters in Business and Economics in January 2011.
                        <br><br>
                        After my graduation I started working for a small E-commerce as a web-administator and in their customer-service. After 1.5 years I grew restless and wanted to do something else (as many in generation Y do).
                        I started working for another company in the corporate group as a content manager. This was my first contact with "programming". If you can call extremely basic HTML-coding "programming". I worked there for another 1.5 years
                        until I decided to work part-time and study a course in basic programming in my spare-time.
                       <br><br>
                        After I "graduated" the course I was sure what I wanted to be when I grew up, A feeling I unfortunately never felt during my time in Uppsala. I applied in the last minute for the
                        2-year long education in Front-End Development and got in.

                    <h2 id="lifeStory">My name is Vilhelm Falkenmark and I am currently 28 years old</h2>

                    <p>I was born In Stockholm, Sweden on the 22nd of june 1986 as the second-eldest sibling among four.

                        <br><br> When I was a kid I was obsessed with Lego, Turtles and Batman. When I turned 10 I discovered Kiss (the band) and my life changed forever to come.
                        I started playing guitar when I was 13 and it has been my main hobby since then. During my youth I spent my free-time playing in various bands and music projects.
                        <br><br>
                        After I finished high-school I went to Australia for 6 months with one of my best friends to "discover myself" and "find out what I really want to do with my life". I did
                        not really achieve that. Instead I applied for an education in Business and Economics. I moved to Uppsala when I turned 20 and studied there for 4 years and 6 months abroad in Maastricht, The Netherlands.
                        I took my Degree of Masters in Business and Economics in January 2011.
                        <br><br>
                        After my graduation I started working for a small E-commerce as a web-administator and in their customer-service. After 1.5 years I grew restless and wanted to do something else (as many in generation Y do).
                        I started working for another company in the corporate group as a content manager. This was my first contact with "programming". If you can call extremely basic HTML-coding "programming". I worked there for another 1.5 years
                        until I decided to work part-time and study a course in basic programming in my spare-time.
                       <br><br>
                        After I "graduated" the course I was sure what I wanted to be when I grew up, A feeling I unfortunately never felt during my time in Uppsala. I applied in the last minute for the
                        2-year long education in Front-End Development and got in.
